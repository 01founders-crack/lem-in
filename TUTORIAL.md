# Lem-in Tutorial in Go

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating the Lem-in program in Go. Lem-in is a complex project that involves parsing input, implementing pathfinding, and simulating ant movement in a colony.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of the Go programming language.
- A development environment set up for Go programming.

## Project Overview

Lem-in is a program that finds the quickest path for a group of ants to move through a colony of rooms and tunnels. The goal is to move all the ants from the start room to the end room with as few moves as possible.

## Step 1: Input Parsing

In this step, you'll read and parse the input file, extracting information about rooms, tunnels, the number of ants, and the start and end rooms. You'll also validate the input for errors.

## Step 2: Data Structures

Create data structures to represent the graph of rooms and tunnels. You'll need structs for rooms, tunnels, and ants. Decide how to store these elements and their connections.

## Step 3: Pathfinding

Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's or BFS) to find the shortest path from the start room to the end room. Ensure that ants can move along the path while avoiding congestion and using tunnels efficiently.

## Step 4: Output Generation

Keep track of each ant's movement and generate output in the required format at each turn. The output should indicate which ant moves from one room to another in each step.

## Step 5: Simulation

Simulate the movement of ants through the colony. Ants should follow the path found by the pathfinding algorithm and avoid overcrowding in rooms.

## Step 6: Error Handling

Implement error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid input, no valid path from start to end, and other unexpected issues.

## Step 7: Visualizer (Optional)

As a bonus, you can create a visualizer to display the ant farm and the movement of ants in a graphical manner.

## Step 8: Testing

Develop unit tests for various components of your program to ensure correctness and robustness.

## Step 9: Documentation and Code Organization

Document your code and use proper code organization and naming conventions to make it readable and maintainable.

## Step 10: Performance Optimization

Depending on the size of the colony and the number of ants, optimize your code for performance.

## Conclusion

Building the Lem-in program in Go is a challenging but rewarding project. Take it one step at a time, thoroughly test your code, and use appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient pathfinding. Good luck with your project!
